# ne-beri-vinchik-nest

This is back-end side of [NBVinchik](https://nbvinchik.com/) web app.

### How Does It Work?
Application gets data from [ElepantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) Database and images/videos from [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage?authuser=0&hl=en).
To fill this data i used simple Telegram Grabber written on Python.

### How i can use?
Project was deployed to [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting). But there is CORS policy for domains other than the front-side app.
